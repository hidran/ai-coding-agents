## 🤝 How to Contribute

## About this Fork

This project is a fork maintained by [hidran](https://github.com/hidran). We welcome contributions that align with the project's goals. Please submit issues and pull requests to this repository.

### Adding New Agents

1. **Choose a Category**: Place your agent in the appropriate category folder (e.g., `code-quality/`)
2. **Follow the Template**: Use the established agent format with YAML frontmatter
3. **Be Specific**: Include detailed examples and clear trigger scenarios
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure your agent works as expected in Claude Code

### Agent Template

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
category: the-category-folder-name
description: Detailed description of when to use this agent, with specific trigger scenarios and delegation examples.
model: sonnet|haiku
# Optional fields:
# tags: [ "tag1", "tag2" ]
# workflow: [ "next-agent-1", "next-agent-2" ]

You are a [ROLE] specialist who helps developers with [SPECIFIC TASK].

## Core Capabilities:
- List specific, actionable capabilities
- Focus on concrete deliverables
- Explain expert knowledge areas

## Specific Scenarios:
- When user asks "specific example request"
- When user mentions specific keywords or contexts
- When certain conditions or problems arise
- When working with specific technologies or patterns

## Expected Outputs:
- Specific deliverables and formats
- Quality standards and requirements
- Documentation and examples included
- Performance or measurement criteria

## Will NOT Handle:
- Tasks better suited for other agents (with defer recommendations)
- Out of scope activities with clear boundaries

When working: Provide specific behavioral instructions, output format requirements, and quality standards.
```

### Agent Quality Standards

#### ✅ Good Agents Have:
- **Specific Trigger Scenarios**: Clear examples of when Claude Code should use this agent
- **Concrete Examples**: Real situations with user quotes and assistant responses
- **Clear Boundaries**: What the agent WILL and WON'T handle
- **Expected Outputs**: Specific deliverables and quality standards
- **Proper Model Selection**: Sonnet for analysis/technical, Haiku for writing/communication

#### ❌ Avoid:
- Generic descriptions without specific use cases
- Vague capabilities like "helps with development"
- Missing examples or delegation scenarios
- Overlapping functionality with existing agents
- Incorrect model selection for the task complexity

### Model Selection Guidelines

**Use Sonnet for:**
- Complex analysis and reasoning tasks
- Technical architecture and system design
- Code review and security analysis
- Strategic planning and prioritization
- Research and competitive analysis

**Use Haiku for:**
- Content creation and writing tasks
- Marketing copy and communications
- Documentation and technical writing
- Simple formatting and template tasks

## 🔧 Development Process

The development workflow is now safer and more automated, thanks to the new build and validation script.

### 1. Fork and Clone
If you haven't already, fork and clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git fork https://github.com/username/claude-agents
git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-agents
cd claude-agents
```

### 2. Create or Edit an Agent
- Find the appropriate category in the repository's root directory (e.g., `code-quality/`).
- Create a new `your-agent-name.md` file or edit an existing one.
- Make sure to follow the template provided in this guide.
- **Crucially**, you must include the `category` field in the YAML frontmatter. This must match the name of the directory the file is in.

### 3. Build and Validate Your Changes
This is the most important new step. After making your changes, run the build script from the root of the project to ensure your contribution is valid.
```bash
./scripts/build.py
```
- **If it succeeds:** The script will automatically validate your agent's format, update the `dist/agents.json` manifest, and regenerate the main `docs/README.md`.
- **If it fails:** The script will print an error telling you exactly what is wrong (e.g., "Missing required field: description"). You must fix the error and run the script again until it succeeds.

### 4. Test Your Agent Locally
Use the `install.sh` script to install your locally modified and validated agents.
```bash
# Install your agents locally
./install.sh

# Test in Claude Code
# Restart your IDE and test your agent with various scenarios.
```

### 5. Commit and Submit a Pull Request
- Commit **all** the files that were modified by you and by the build script. This includes:
    - Your new or edited agent file (e.g., `docs/code-quality/my-new-agent.md`).
    - The updated `dist/agents.json`.
    - The updated `README.md`.
- Push your changes and open a pull request. The maintainers can see that the build script has already validated your contribution, which will speed up the review process.

## 📝 Agent Categories

### Existing Categories:
- **architecture** - System design and planning
- **code-quality** - Code review, testing, security
- **design** - UI/UX, branding, visual design
- **marketing** - Copy, content, advertising
- **product** - Product management, UX, feedback
- **business** - Legal, strategy, planning
- **devops** - Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring
- **data** - Analytics, SQL, reporting
- **communication** - Documentation, support, presentations  
- **research** - Technology research and analysis

### Suggesting New Categories:
- Create an issue explaining the need for a new category
- Provide examples of 3-5 agents that would fit
- Explain how it's different from existing categories

## 🐛 Bug Reports

When reporting issues with agents:

1. **Agent Name**: Which specific agent has the problem
2. **Expected Behavior**: What you expected the agent to do  
3. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened
4. **Context**: The request you made to Claude Code
5. **Reproduction Steps**: How to reproduce the issue

## 💡 Feature Requests

For new agent ideas:

1. **Use Case**: What problem would this agent solve
2. **Target Audience**: Who would benefit from this agent
3. **Examples**: Specific scenarios where it would be used
4. **Differentiation**: How it's different from existing agents

## ✅ Code Review Process

All contributions go through review:

1. **Technical Review**: Ensure proper YAML format and agent structure
2. **Quality Review**: Verify examples, scenarios, and capabilities are clear
3. **Testing Review**: Confirm the agent works as described
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure README updates if needed

## 📖 Style Guide

### Agent Naming
- Use kebab-case: `user-story-writer`, not `UserStoryWriter`
- Be specific: `landing-page-writer`, not `writer`
- Avoid redundant words: `sql-expert`, not `sql-database-expert`

### Description Writing
- Start with "Use this agent when you need to..."
- Include specific trigger scenarios  
- Reference concrete examples with user quotes
- End with model specification

### Examples Format
```markdown
<example>
Context: Brief situation description
user: "Exact quote of what user might say"
assistant: "Response showing how agent helps"
<commentary>
Explanation of why this agent should be used in this scenario
</commentary>
</example>
```
